# Chen's  CS Note ❤

---

1. Happiness is an attitude. We either make ourselves miserable, or happy and strong. The amount of work is the same.
2. "I just want you to know that if you are out there and you are being really hard on yourself right now for something that has happened ... it's normal. That is what is going to happen to you in life. No one gets through unscathed. We are all going to have a few scratches on us. Please be kind to yourselves and stand up for yourself, please."
   —Taylor Swift
